This was a course that taught me how to make my own iOS app through Xcode and learning how to use the Swift programming language. It requires an apple laptop to utilize Xcode.
Hopefully this link is still accessable, but this is where the demos and code library is located: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2023fall/SwiftLibrary2.html
